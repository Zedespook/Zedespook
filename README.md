# Who am I does not matter, what I do does.

**Hi, and welcome to my page! 👋**

## About me

I'm mostly a game developer 🕹️, working in the ever evolving Godot Engine. However, I'm also very passionate about automation 🤖 which I mostly do in Python and AutoHotKey; there are also automation related technologies like RPA that I'm excited about.
